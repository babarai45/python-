#what is programming?
#programming is the process of creating a set 
# of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task.
# These instructions can be written in a number of different "languages",
# or which are simply different ways of organizing the instructions and text.
# The set of instructions is often called a program or a script.
# The computer follows the instructions in the program one after the other, 
# until the end.
# The order of the instructions is crucial to the computer,
# and they are executed in a very literal manner.   
# Programming is a very creative and rewarding activity,
# but it can also be frustrating and time-consuming.
# If you have ever spent hours trying to find a missing semicolon,
# you will know what I mean.
# The computer will do exactly what you tell it to do.
#what is python?
#Python is a programming language.
#Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
#Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
#Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
#Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
#Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.
#why python?
#Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).  
#Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
#Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
#Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be 
# executed as soon as it is written.
#This means that prototyping can be very quick.
