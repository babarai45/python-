 Here is a suggested outline for 5 sections on programming in Python:

1. Programming Fundamentals
- Basic syntax and keywords
- Variables and data types 
- Conditional statements
- Loops
- Functions

2. Sequential Programming
- Input/output operations
- File handling
- Exceptions
- Modules and packages

3. Functional Programming
- Pure functions
- First-class functions
- Higher-order functions 
- Lambda functions
- Map, filter, reduce

4. Object Oriented Programming
- Classes and objects
- Inheritance 
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism
- Abstract classes

5. Data Structures
- Built-in data structures like lists, tuples, dicts
- Stacks and queues
- Linked lists
- Trees
- Graphs

Some other topics that could be added:
- GUI programming with Tkinter or PyQt
- Web development with Django or Flask
- Databases and SQLAlchemy
- Testing with unittest
- Concurrency with threads and processes
- Network programming 
- Scientific computing with NumPy and Pandas

Let me know if you would like me to expand on any of
these sections further. I'm happy to provide more details on covering
core Python programming concepts and techniques.
