#what is programming?
#programming is the process of creating a set 
# of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task.
# These instructions can be written in a number of different "languages",
# or which are simply different ways of organizing the instructions and text.
# The set of instructions is often called a program or a script.
# The computer follows the instructions in the program one after the other, 
# until the end.
# The order of the instructions is crucial to the computer,
# and they are executed in a very literal manner.   
# Programming is a very creative and rewarding activity,
# but it can also be frustrating and time-consuming.
# If you have ever spent hours trying to find a missing semicolon,
# you will know what I mean.
# The computer will do exactly what you tell it to do.
print ("hello world")

# Pyton Variable and Data Type ?
# Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:
# expalin each datatypes with all function and  examples 
  


# Text Type:	str
# string is 
# Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
# Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
# Mapping Type:	dict
# Set Types:	set, frozenset
# Boolean Type:	bool
# Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview
# Getting the Data Type 
# what is getting the data type ?

# You can get the data type of any object by using the type() function:
# Example
# Print the data type of the variable x:
x = 5
print(type(x))
# Setting the Data Type
# In Python, the data type is set when you assign a value to a variable:
# Example
# Setting the data type of a variable
x = "Hello World"	# str
x = 20	# int
x = 20.5	# float
x = 1j	# complex
x = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]	# list
x = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")	# tuple
x = range(6)	# range
x = {"name" : "John", "age" : 36}	# dict
x = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}	# set
x = frozenset({"apple", "banana", "cherry"})	# frozenset
x = True	# bool
x = b"Hello"	# bytes
x = bytearray(5)	# bytearray
x = memoryview(bytes(5))	# memoryview
